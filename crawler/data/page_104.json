    "intro": "Do you like poker, but want to raise the stakes? Try a flirty and mature version of the classic card game, one in which adult players can literally lose the shirts off their backs— and maybe more. In strip poker, players wager items of clothing they are wearing, and by the end of the game several players often end up in their underwear ... or even naked.",
