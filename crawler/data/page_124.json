    "intro": "Twenty questions is a classic game that can be played almost anywhere. It’s great to use when passing the time, meeting new people, or learning more about grammar. To play the basic version of this game, you don’t need anything but yourself and a willing group of players. We’ll fill you in on the rules and give helpful tips for asking questions and thinking up answers. We’ll also show you how to tailor the game for an ESL classroom, and introduce you to similar games to play with your friends, family, or students.",
