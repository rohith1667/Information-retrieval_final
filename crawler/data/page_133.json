    "intro": "Labrador retrievers are incredibly cute dogs. Their roly-poly bellies, happy smiles, and wagging tails just capture our hearts. However, these dogs do need some training. Labradors are high-energy animals, especially since their breed was developed to work, hunt, and run all day.",

                        "For example, Labradors need to play and be thoroughly walked. If you don't do this, they often become bored and destructive. Keep them active by playing fetch and going on substantial walks at least twice a day. Increased physical activity helps a dog stay healthy and also tires them out. A tired out Labrador will, in turn, be less inclined to help himself to the food in your cupboards and dig up your garden. Swimming is also excellent exercise for a dog and playing fetch in the water is a great combination that expends a lot of dog energy."
