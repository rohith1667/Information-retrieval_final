    "intro": " The midrange is the average of the range of a set of numbers, or the sum of the highest and lowest numbers divided by two. This quick equation can help you estimate the middle point of a set of numbers, similar to the mean or median. However, midrange is more useful for some datasets than others, so keep reading to learn when you should use it versus median.",
