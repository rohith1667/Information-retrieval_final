    "intro": "Self-care activities can help you cope with stress and improve overall well-being. Practicing self-care is especially important if you have many responsibilities, like going to school, working at a stressful job, or taking care of a loved one. A good deal of practicing self care is learning how to understand your own needs emotionally, physically, and professionally. If you can understand your needs and learn to put yourself first sometimes, you'll be able to better take care of yourself and your other responsibilities.",
