    "intro": " Did you know that you can create a hidden photo album on your iPhone? On iOS 16 and later, you can move your most private photos and videos to the Hidden album in the Photos app, which is protected by Face ID or Touch ID. Nothing in the Hidden album will appear in your library or in other albums, and you can unhide them at any time. On earlier versions of iOS, you can still hide photos and videos, but you can't lock the album without a third-party app. This wikiHow article will walk you through the simple steps of making a locked private photo album on your iPhone that nobody can access but you.",
