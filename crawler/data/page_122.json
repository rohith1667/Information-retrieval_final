    "intro": "Animal Crossing: New Horizons is the latest in Nintendo's series of open-ended, real-time social simulation games, Animal Crossing.  In Animal Crossing, you create a character and set up a home in a world populated with anthropomorphic animal characters.  You can interact with the characters and accomplish tasks, such as fishing, bug catching, and collecting items each day.  You can also customize your house and the world you live in.  The Animal Crossing series uses real-world time as reflected by the time and date on your game console.  The time of day, as well as the season, is accurately reflected by in-game time.  Certain tasks can only be accomplished at certain times of the day or during certain times of the year.  Animal Crossing: New Horizons is set on a deserted island and has many new features.  This wikiHow teaches you how to get started playing Animal Crossing: New Horizons.",
