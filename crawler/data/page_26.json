    "intro": " This wikiHow teaches you how to capture an image of everything that's on your iPhone's screen. The steps to take a screenshot are a bit different depending on your model of iPhone, but it always involves pressing two buttons at the same time. If you are unable to use the buttons on your iPhone for any reason, you can use an accessibility feature called AssistiveTouch to capture a screenshot with one finger.",
