    "intro": "Nurses, doctors, and other professionals in health fields use osmolarity to figure out the levels of glucose, sodium chloride, and other particles in blood, urine, and other solutions. To calculate the osmolarity of a solution, the first step is to convert the number to moles per liter. Convert that number to osmoles per liter and add the osmolarity of each particle together to get the solution's osmolarity. Keep reading to learn how to solve any osmolarity problem in just a few simple steps.",
