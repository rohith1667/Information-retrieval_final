    "intro": "Never Have I Ever is a really fun way to get to know people, or to learn more about people you already know. You can play the basic version of the game, which is suitable for all ages. Or you can turn into a drinking game for a group of people above drinking age. If you do play the drinking game version, make sure you don’t drink too much and you don’t drive afterward.",
