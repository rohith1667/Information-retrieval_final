    "intro": " Did DoorDash deactivate your Dasher account? DoorDash may disable your account if you have a low rating, low completion rate, too complaints, or some other violation. DoorDash deactivations can come suddenly and without warning â€” even while you're in the middle of a delivery. Unlike many other delivery apps, DoorDash gives most deactivated Dashers a chance to file an appeal. This wikiHow article will show you how to appeal your DoorDash deactivation and get your DoorDash driver account back.",
