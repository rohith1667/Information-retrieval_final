    "intro": "Are you starting to feel a little burnt out by all the texts you’re getting? Constant conversations and notifications, whether it’s a friend always venting or coworkers reaching out after hours, make it harder to focus and could start stressing you out. Luckily, putting limits on when and how often you reply helps you feel less overwhelmed. We’ll start with ways to choose and enforce your boundaries before covering what to say if someone tries to reach you when you’re not available.",
