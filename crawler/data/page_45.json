    "intro": "Have you heard the term “TPK” mentioned before but aren’t sure what it means? Or are you a DM looking for ways to adapt after a TPK in your home game? We can help. TPK is a shortened way to say “total party kill,” which happens when an entire party of PCs dies. After a TPK, some might prefer finding a way to use the same characters again, while others might want to start fresh and make new ones. Read on for a complete guide to navigating TPKs, including how to prepare for one and what to do after it happens.",
