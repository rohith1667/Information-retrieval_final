    "intro": "If you have a “babyface,” you're probably used to being told you look younger than your age. The typical babyface characteristics—rounder cheeks and a bit more facial fat—tend to make people appear more youthful. There is absolutely nothing wrong with having a babyface, and you don’t need to take any action to change things! However, if you’re hoping to reduce facial fat or fullness, there are options. Facial exercises, reducing overall body weight, changing your makeup or hairstyle, or cosmetic procedures can help you slim down your face to appear more mature.",
