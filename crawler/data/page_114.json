    "intro": " is a rhythm-based game for the PC, PlayStation 2, Nintendo Wii, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360. You play a \"guitar\" in time with many well known tracks. Playing requires nothing more than a sense of the music's beat, a small degree of patience, a love of at least a few of the songs present, and most importantly - ludicrously dexterous fingers (a skill which can be acquired).

                        "Star Power, alluded to above, as a quality which you increase if you play all of the notes successfully in a series of \"star notes\". These notes appear in the shape of spinning stars rather than circles, and often appear in the more grandiose pieces of music. If there is a  star note, using the whammy bar on this will give you extra star power. Try to nail these if you can! If you get enough of it (the meter fills up beyond its mark), you can \"use\" it and enter star power mode by briefly tilting up your guitar or pressing the Select button. This will temporarily double the points that you get from each note, and drastically increase the rate that your popularity rises; so try to use it when there are lots of consecutive notes. Also, once you enter Star Mode, there is no exiting it until the power meter drains out, so wait until there are notes coming up or your Star Power will be wasted. You can also use Star Power to help you get through tough parts of songs that you can't get through otherwise.",
                        "Hammer-ons and Pull-offs, Looking closely at the notes moving up the screen, you'll see that some notes are different than others. Normal notes have a hollow, black center, while \"hammer-on\" notes have a filled-in, white center. To simulate real guitar playing, some sequences of notes can be played by hammering-on or pulling-off: Simply strum normally for the black-center note (the first note in the sequence), and just press the correct button for the filled-in notes at the right time. \"Hammer-on\" notes will register as correctly played as long as you time it correctly. Try to perfect this technique, since eventually, on the most difficult songs, notes become too fast and close together to strum accurately.",
                        "Whammying, If you can hit long notes, then you can use the whammy bar. On long notes (sustains), move the whammy bar up and down. Make sure you whammy on the star power sustains, you'll get more Star Power in your meter! Whammying does not give you any advantage on normal held notes, it's just fun to do."
