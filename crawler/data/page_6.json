    "intro": "Gold is a precious metal that comes in a variety of colors and different levels of fineness. The value of a piece of jewelry or another object will depend greatly on whether or not it is plated or pure gold. To identify the quality of a metal object, start by taking a close look at its surface. If you're still unsure, move on to more in-depth testing, such as a vinegar application. As a final option, consider applying acid to the metal item and watching for a reaction.",

                    "subtitle": " Look closely at the divot that you made earlier and where you just applied the acid. The acid will react with the metal and may turn a particular color. Generally, if the acid turns a green color, this indicates that the piece is not pure metal, but instead gold plated or another metal entirely. Since testing kits have different color indications, make sure to read the color guide carefully as you interpret the test results.",

                        "You can also do the nitric acid test. Nitric acid can help determine the presence of base metals in gold items. Apply a small amount of nitric acid to a discreet part of the item. Observe any color changes; if the acid causes the metal to turn green, it may indicate a lower gold content."
