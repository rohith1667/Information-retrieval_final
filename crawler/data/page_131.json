    "intro": "Gastric torsion and bloat, or GDV, is a serious veterinary emergency in dogs. It involves the stomach filling with air and then twisting along its long axis. As the stomach twists, it cuts off blood supply to the stomach tissues along with associated other tissues connected to the outside of the stomach. Needless to say, this causes serious consequences to the health of the affected dog and if you suspect your dog has this problem please call your veterinarian or veterinary emergency clinic immediately! Because this condition is so serious, as a Lab owner you should know how to spot the signs and what to do once you suspect it is occurring.",

Dog’s that are “greedy” eaters, gulping their food down and swallowing air as they gulp, can fill their stomachs with air.
